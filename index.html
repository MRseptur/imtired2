	<h1>   Why are we tired every day?</h1>
	
	<p> The lack of sleep: The most common reason for feeling tired is simply not getting enough sleep. The recommended amount of sleep for adults is between 7-9 hours per night, but many people fall short of this goal.

Poor sleep quality: Even if you are getting enough hours of sleep, if the quality of your sleep is poor, you may still feel tired. Common causes of poor sleep quality include snoring, sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or simply sleeping in an uncomfortable environment, like a noisy classroom.

Poor nutrition: Eating a healthy and balanced diet is essential for maintaining energy levels throughout the day. Eating too many processed or sugary foods can lead to a quick spike in energy followed by a crash, leaving you feeling tired.
		
Lack of exercise: Regular exercise can boost your energy levels, but not getting enough physical activity can leave you feeling tired and lethargic.

Stress and anxiety: Mental and emotional stress can take a toll on your body, leading to fatigue and exhaustion.
		
Medical conditions: Chronic fatigue syndrome, anemia, thyroid disorders, and other medical conditions can also cause fatigue and tiredness.

Overall, feeling tired every day is a common experience, but it is important to identify the underlying causes and make lifestyle changes to improve your energy levels and overall well-being. </p>
